## 1. Requirements

You need to have the following to follow this guide:

- An Android smartphone with
    - ARMv8 or x86 architecture *
    - Android 8 or later *

Don't know what these are? Don't worry, we will check for the ones marked with (*) later in this guide.

## 2. Checking versions

We are going to start patching now, but first we need to check supported version of YouTube.

The latest supported YT version is:

```
19.43.41
```

[![It is 19.43.41](https://img.shields.io/badge/Latest%20Supported%20Version-19.43.41-ff0000?style=for-the-badge&logo=youtube)](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/youtube/youtube-19-43-41-release/youtube-19-43-41-2-android-apk-download/)

as of 2025-01-20T07:34 UTC. Remember that, as we will use it very soon.

## 3. Getting the files ready

In this section, you can find the latest supported Revanced Manager, GmsCore and YouTube APK

1. Download and install the latest **stable** [ReVanced manager (RVM)](https://github.com/ReVanced/ReVanced-manager/releases/latest)

6. Download **but don't install** the YT APK
!!!warning Warning
**Do NOT install the downloaded YouTube APK.**

## 4. Checking compatibility

1. launch RVM. Ignore any updates it claimed it knew. You may not have the red shaded part, that's normal.
==- Image for reference
![launch rvm](https://github.com/SodaWithoutSparkles/ReVanced-troubleshooting-guide/blob/main/screenshots/040-first_launch_manager.jpg?raw=true)
===
2. Go to the settings tab and scroll down until you find "About"
==- Image for reference
![check about](https://github.com/SodaWithoutSparkles/ReVanced-troubleshooting-guide/blob/main/screenshots/050-check_about.jpg?raw=true)
===
3. Check that `Arch` had at least 1 entry that looks like `arm64-v8a`
4. If you only got something that said `armv7` or lower, you cannot patch it on your phone. Please patch it on another device or your PC.
5. If you got `armv8` or higher, you are probably fine
6. Check that your Android version is at least 8
7. If you only got something that said `7` or lower, you cannot patch it on your phone. Please patch it on another device or your PC.
8. If you made it here, you can probably patch on your phone with ReVanced manager

## 5. Select APK

1. Go to the Patcher tab and click "Select an application"

3. If that does not work, install [SAI](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aefyr.sai) and use that to install instead
4. Keep calm, you don't need to patch again. Just use the exported one in Step 1
