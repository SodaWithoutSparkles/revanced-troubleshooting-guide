# 2. Checking versions

We are going to start patching now, but first we need to check the suggested version of YouTube.

=== You can see the version in ReVanced Manager
![The suggested version should be 19.16.39 now](https://github.com/SodaWithoutSparkles/ReVanced-troubleshooting-guide/blob/main/screenshots/101-check_ver_manager.jpg?raw=true)
===

The suggested YT version is:

```
19.16.39
```

[![It is 19.16.39](https://img.shields.io/badge/Suggested%20Version-19.16.39-ff0000?style=for-the-badge&logo=youtube)](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/youtube/youtube-19-16-39-release/youtube-19-16-39-android-apk-download/)

as of 2024-08-04T20:36 UTC. Remember that, as we will use it very soon.

==- How to check manually
1. Go to the official [ReVanced patches website](https://revanced.app/patches?pkg=com.google.android.youtube)
2. Select `com.google.android.youtube` if not already selected
3. Find the ðŸŽ¯ icon for the latest supported version of each patch
4. The version you should use is the one that has the lowest version number to ensure maximum compatibility
