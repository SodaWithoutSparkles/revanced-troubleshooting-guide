# 7. Patching Done!

1. After patching is done, export the patched APK for backup.

![export and install](https://github.com/SodaWithoutSparkles/ReVanced-troubleshooting-guide/blob/main/screenshots/150-export_install.jpg?raw=true)
===
2. Install the patched APK
!!!
Install it in the patching complete screen. You don't need to install the exported one.
!!!
3. If that does not work, install SAI ([Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aefyr.sai), [apkmirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/polychromaticfox/split-apks-installer-sai/)) and use that to install instead
4. Keep calm, you don't need to patch again. Just use the exported one in Step 1
