# State File Importance

## Why `.conf/python/update.state` Must Be Tracked

The `update.state` file serves a critical function in the ReVanced version updater:

### What it contains:
1. **Timestamp**: When the last update was performed
2. **Data snapshot**: JSON representation of the last known patch data

### Why it's essential:
1. **Prevents unnecessary updates**: Without it, the script would update files on every run
2. **Tracks state across deployments**: GitHub Actions needs this to know when last update occurred
3. **Enables smart scheduling**: Only updates when versions actually change or after 1 week
4. **Preserves workflow efficiency**: Prevents spam commits and rebuilds

### Example content:
```
1750263157
{"com.google.android.youtube": {"latest_version": "20.12.46", ...}, ...}
```

### What happens without it:
- ❌ Script assumes it's the first run and forces updates
- ❌ Files get updated unnecessarily on every workflow run
- ❌ Website rebuilds constantly even with no version changes
- ❌ Commit history gets cluttered with redundant updates

### Conclusion:
Unlike the API cache files (`patches_list.json`, `patches_version.json`) which are purely temporary downloads, the state file contains **persistent state information** that must be preserved between runs.
