# 8. Patching Done!

1. After patching is done, export the patched APK for backup.
2. Uninstall the original app if you have it installed.
3. Install the patched APK at the patching complete screen.
!!!
The exported APK is just for backup, you don't need to install it now.

4. If that does not work, install [SAI](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aefyr.sai) and use that to install instead
!!!
Use the exported apk with SAI, you don't need to patch again.
