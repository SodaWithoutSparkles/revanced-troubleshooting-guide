# 2. Checking versions

We are going to start patching now, but first we need to check the latest version to patch. You can find the information [here](/05-versions.md).

==- How to check manually (with manager)
1. Launch ReVanced manager
2. In patcher tab, click Select an Application
3. Find the app that you want to patch.
4. If you don't have the app installed, search for the package name of the app. 
!!!
Package name can be found by searching "\<app name\> package name" in a browser.
5. The version you should use is the one suggested by the manager.
