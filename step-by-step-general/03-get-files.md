# 3. Getting the files ready

In this section, you can find the latest supported Revanced Manager, GmsCore and YouTube APK.

1. Download and install the latest **stable** [ReVanced Manager](https://github.com/ReVanced/ReVanced-manager/releases/latest) to your device
!!!
Download the .apk, not the source code. 
The latest stable version may differ from the one shown below.

Do **NOT** try to find the manager version shown in the image, it might be outdated.

2. In patcher tab, tap Select an Application
3. Find the app that you want to patch.
!!! If you cannot find the app...
If you have not installed the app on your phone, the package name would be shown instead.
These would be indicated by a missing icon. You can find a lookup table [here](/05-versions.md).
You can also find the package name for an app by searching "\<app name\> package name" in a browser.

If you are certain that you have the app installed, using the search bar may help.
!!!
4. The suggested version of the app would be shown. 
!!! If it said "Any version"
This means that nobody has reported a version that did not work *yet*.
It means that you can *try* the latest version of apk available.
In case it doesn't work, go back a few versions and check if it works, and repeat if it doesn't.
You can also report back the version that works for you at [Discord](https://discord.gg/revanced) or [Github (if nobody else has reported)](https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-patches/issues)
!!!
5. You can tap the version shown to open an online search result of the suggested apk. You can also just google it.
6. If there are multiple variants, you most likely need the one marked `arm64-v8a` and `APK` (not bundle).
=== Image for reference
![This variant is both `arm-v8a` and is an apk](https://github.com/SodaWithoutSparkles/ReVanced-troubleshooting-guide/blob/main/screenshots/021-verify-apk-not-bundle.jpg?raw=true)
===
7. Verify that it said "DOWNLOAD APK" not "DOWNLOAD APK BUNDLE". The file should end with `.apk` not `.apks` or `.apkm`.
=== Image for reference
![The one marked with a blue :icon-check: is the correct one](https://github.com/SodaWithoutSparkles/ReVanced-troubleshooting-guide/blob/main/screenshots/021-verify-apk-not-bundle.jpg?raw=true)
===
8. Download **but don't install** the APK
