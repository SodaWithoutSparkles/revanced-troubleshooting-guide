# 2.11. What patch should I select?

Select the default/recommended ones. When you are in the select patches window, you can click the "default" or "recommended" button on the top. You can review the defaults, but don't exclude patches that you don't know what it means. It is probably needed. Don't worry about functions that you may not like, you can disable them in-app later.

DO NOT SELECT ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PATCHES OR YOU WILL RISK HAVING ISSUES: 

- `Change package name`
- `Change version code`
- `Enable Android debugging`
- `Export all activities`
- `Hex`
- `Override certificate pinning`
- `Predictive back gesture`
- `Remove screen capture restriction`
- `Remove screenshot restriction`
- `Spoof wifi connections`
- `Spoof SIM country`
- `Spoof Wi-Fi connection`

You can disable the following patches safely. I have tested them:
- `Disable auto captions`
- `Hide player overlay`
- `Hide seekbar`
- `Hide timestamp`
- `Wide search bar`
