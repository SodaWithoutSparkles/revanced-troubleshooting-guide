# 2.14. ReVanced manager aborting / exit code 135 / exit code 139 / ARMv7 devices

If you see the text "exit code = 135" or "exit code = 139", then your devices architecture is not supported. 

You are probably using ARMv7. ReVanced Manager has support for ARMv7 since `v1.21.0`. [Update ReVanced Manager](https://github.com/ReVanced/ReVanced-manager/releases/latest) and try again.

If that doesn't work, you can patch on a computer with the [`revanced-cli` (official)](/06-revanced-cli.md), [`Taku's auto-cli` (**Very Easy**)](https://github.com/taku-nm/auto-cli) or [`revanced-builder`](https://github.com/reisxd/revanced-builder).
