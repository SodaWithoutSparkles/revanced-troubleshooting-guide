# 3.2. Video playback issues / buffers / buggy / content not available

==- I have `Spoof Video Streams` patch already
First reboot your phone to see if this issue resolves itself. If not...

1. Reboot your device again
2. Disable battery optimization for GmsCore and Youtube ReVanced
3. Clear cache for YouTube Revanced
4. Check if issue persists
5. If so, clear data of YouTube ReVanced, reboot, and try again

Patch again with the `Spoof Video Streams` patch. (_`spoof signature verification` was merged into `Spoof Video Streams`_)

The process is the same as updating ReVanced, which you can find a guide [here](/07-update-revanced.md)

If you cannot find them, you probably patched an unsupported YT version or used non-default patch sources
